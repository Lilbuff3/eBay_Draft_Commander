# eBay Draft Commander Pro - Project Roadmap

> **Vision**: A complete eBay selling dashboard that makes selling not just easier, but more **profitable and measured**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Automate listing creation** - Drop photos → AI analysis → Published listing
2. **Edit existing listings** - Bulk update prices, titles, inventory
3. **Measure profitability** - Track sales, fees, profit margins, ROI
4. **Analytics dashboard** - Conversion rates, best sellers, pricing insights
5. **Mobile access** - Manage listings on the go

## 📊 Market Viability (Honest Assessment)

### The Good
- **Real pain point**: eBay's Seller Hub is clunky; power sellers need better tools
- **AI differentiation**: Gemini-powered analysis is genuinely useful for unique items
- **You're the target user**: Building for yourself = authentic product decisions
- **Market exists**: Listing tools like Vendoo, List Perfectly charge $20-100/mo

### The Challenges
- **Crowded space**: Many listing tools exist (though most lack AI)
- **eBay API limits**: Some features require enterprise tier access
- **Support burden**: SaaS requires customer support infrastructure

### Recommendation
**Start as a personal tool, validate through your own usage, then consider:**
1. Open-source with optional paid features (freemium)
2. One-time purchase (avoid recurring support obligation)
3. YouTube content showing the tool → organic marketing
